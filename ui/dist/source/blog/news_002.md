In support of the longer-term sustainability of ESIP's Data Management Training Clearinghouse (DMTC), DMTC leadership plans to describe the applicable core characteristics of the DMTC according to a recently released white paper published by the Research Data Alliance's Education and Training on the Handling of Research Data Interest Group (ETHRD-IG):  [Core Characteristics of Learning Resource Collectors](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00072).  The intention for making  information available about the content, content descriptions, governance, services, and operations is to help DMTC users, contributors and funders gain a better understanding of the breadth and depth of DMTC's value and contribution to education and training on research data skills.  Stay tuned for updates on this DMTC documentation.
