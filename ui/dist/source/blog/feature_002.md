If you are interested in finding out more -- a LOT more about remote sensing, the DMTC has an excellent (and growing!) number of learning resources on remote sensing -- from introductory level to more advanced applications of remote sensing in different subject domains.  Of special interest are the resources being put out to the public, free of charge, from NASA's Applied Remote Sensing Training Program (ARSET).  A simple search for "remote sensing" results in over 30 resources with more in the queue to be added in the near future.  These resources are a great way to get your feet wet, but also to dive in to specific applications of remote sensing in agriculture, the understanding of tribal lands, freshwater habitats, coastal ecosystems and many more.  Most of these resources are available in other languages as well.  Check 'em out!
