# Soft Launch to be scheduled soon!
Stay tuned for the date of the Soft Launch of the newly enhanced ESIP-hosted Data Management Training Clearinghouse!  A modified documentation model and added flexibility in the DMTC platform will allow both broader and more precise searching so that you have a better chance to find the educational resources that will suit your needs -- either as a teacher or a learner of research data skills.  Whether you are looking to update your skills for an existing course or job, or want to move into an entirely new area, the DMTC should make it easier to find standalone or a series of educational resources that could fit the bill.  Check back often to find out when the new platform will be live!
