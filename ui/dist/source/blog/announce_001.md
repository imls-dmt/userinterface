As you can probably tell, we're **LIVE** with a newly enhanced ESIP-hosted Data Management Training Clearinghouse!  A modified documentation model and added flexibility in the DMTC platform allows both broader and more precise searching so that you have a better chance to find the educational and training resources that will suit your needs -- either as a teacher or a learner of research data skills.  Whether you are looking to update your skills for an existing course or job, or want to move into an entirely new area, the DMTC should make it easier to find a standalone or a series of resources that could fit the bill.  Let us know what you think of the new interface at our [contact address](clearinghouseEd@esipfed.org)!
