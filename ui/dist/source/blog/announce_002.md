You will soon have an opportunity to join with your teaching colleagues in testing and submitting your favorite tutorials and other education materials in a crowdsourcing event planned for the newly enhanced Data Management Training Clearinghouse (DMTC) in mid-October of 2022!  A newly enhanced user interface to the DMTC will make submission of these materials available for others to use, and adapt if that is allowed.  Notice of this free crowdsourcing event will be sent to research data communities internationally.  We look forward to seeing you there!
