#### Submission Processes Explained

##### Two paths to the submission workflow

How much time do you have to submit information into the DMTC about an excellent learning resource that you have created or found?

There are two options for submitting information about a resource -- **basic** -- if you are short on time -- or **advanced** if you are committed to providing a more complete description of the resource for others to read.

###### Path One: Basic Entry Form

If you only have a moment and don't want to lose the name and location, as an **_Authenticated User_** with a login account to the DMTC, you can drop very brief, but critical information into the **basic** submission form. The required information for this level includes:

- the title
- the URL to the landing page of the resource
- a response to question of whether there is a cost to access the resource (Yes No N/A)

That's it! âŒ› You can always come back later and add more complete information in the **advanced** submission form by going to the next role level as an authenticated **_Submitter_**.

###### Path Two: Advanced Entry Form

With **_Submitter_** status, you can add other important information about the resource on the advanced entry form if you know it (and have a little more time) such as the author(s), publisher, license if assigned and citation if available including the persistent identifier (e.g., DOI).

Many times, this information can be found on the **landing page** for the resource. In this context, a landing page for the resource will tell you more about the resource and often other contextual information such as the resource's relation to other resources, e.g., if it is one topical unit in a sequence of topics.

If you have created or contributed to or taught the resource and know the educational context of the resource, searchers are particularly appreciative of knowing the purpose and learning outcomes that a user of the resouuce can expect and the target audience for which you created the resource.
