Static content for the DMTC user interface

This repository contains the JSON content and pointer files and referenced static content
for insertion into the Data Management Training Clearinghouse user interface. The content
model is based upon custom JSON wrappers that include content metadata and pointers to
related Markdown files representing the content itself. It also provides the static 
source imagery referenced by the user interface. 

Static content is available through: http://static.dmtc-devel.org/<resource path>.
